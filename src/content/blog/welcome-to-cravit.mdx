# Welcome to Cravit

Hey everyone! We're thrilled to officially introduce **Cravit** — your new food discovery companion that turns restaurant exploration into personal missions.

We just launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/cravit) and hit **#11 for the day**. The full App Store release is coming soon, but you can start exploring right now.

## What Is Cravit?

Cravit is a social food-discovery app built around one core idea: **personal food missions called Cravies**.

<ImageFull src="/mockups/Home.png" alt="Cravit home screen showing active Cravies" caption="Your Cravies dashboard — all your food missions in one place" />

A Cravy is simple. You create a mission — like "Find the best smash burger in Milan" or "Our group's new favorite aperitivo bar" — set the criteria that matter to you (taste, vibe, price, portion size), add spots you want to try, invite your friends, and log reviews as you visit each place.

At the end, you get a leaderboard showing which spot actually wins. No spreadsheets. No scattered notes. No confusion about where you're actually going next.

## Why We Built This

The story's simple. When I moved to Milan, I found myself in the same situation three times with different groups of friends:

1. Trying to find "our pub" — that one place that becomes *your* spot (like McLaren's from How I Met Your Mother)
2. On a mission to find the best smash burger in the city
3. Hunting for the perfect Sunday breakfast spot with my roommate

Every time, we ended up creating random notes, spreadsheets, Instagram saves. Nothing organized. Nothing fun. And we never actually knew which place won.

After doing this three times in three completely different ways, I thought: *why doesn't this exist as an app?*

So we built it.

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Cravy

<ImageRight src="/features/Create-Cravy.png" alt="Creating a new Cravy">

Start by defining your mission. Give it a name, pick a category (restaurants, bars, pizza spots, cafés), and set the criteria that matter to you.

Want to judge by taste, vibe, and price? Or maybe portion size and service speed? You decide what counts — and how much each criterion weighs in the final score.

### 2. Add Spots to Try

<ImageLeft src="/features/Add-Spot.png" alt="Adding a spot to your Cravy">

Search for places using Google Maps integration and add them to your Cravy. Build your hit list of spots to visit.

You can add as many spots as you want — whether it's 5 burger joints or 20 pizza places across the city.

### 3. Visit and Review

<ImageRight src="/features/Review.png" alt="Leaving a review">

Every time you visit a spot, log your experience. Rate each criterion, add notes about what stood out, and attach photos to remember the moment.

Your reviews are personal and contextual — they live inside your Cravy, not scattered across random apps.

</ImageRight>

### 4. See Who Wins

As you complete reviews, Cravit calculates scores and builds a leaderboard. Finally, you'll know which spot is *actually* the best — according to your own taste.

## Make It Social

Cravies are even better with friends. Invite your crew to join a mission and see how your tastes compare.

Who has the best palate? Who's the pickiest? The leaderboard will tell you. It's friendly competition that makes food discovery feel like an adventure.

## What Can You Do With Cravit?

**Solo missions.** Want to systematically find the best pizza in your city? Create a Cravy, add spots, rate them by your own criteria, and get a personalized ranking.

**Group missions.** Invite friends to join your Cravy and compare results. Build food traditions together — find "your" pizza place, "your" burger spot, "your" bar.

**Track your journey.** Every review is logged with notes, photos, and ratings per criterion. You're building a personal food history, not just a random collection of saved restaurants.

**Compete (in a fun way).** Leaderboards, badges, and progress tracking turn food discovery into a game. Because finding great restaurants shouldn't feel like a chore.

## Core Features

**Pro tip:** Start with something specific like "Best Pizza in [Your City]" — it's easier to stay motivated when the mission is clear.
